  Abstract                 = {We report a single step procedure to prepare monodisperse colloidal poly(methyl)methacrylate (PMMA) particles where fluorescent dyes are incorporated into the polymer network. The particles are sterically stabilized against flocculation by poly(12-hydroxystearic acid). The fluorescent dyes are RITC (rhodamine isothiocyanate)-aminostyrene (RAS) and 4-methylaminoethylmethacrylate-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol (NBD-MAEM), which are prepared from (commercially available) RITC and 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol (NBD-Cl), respectively, as starting materials. The particles can be grown larger with nonfluorescent PMMA. Examples of the usefulness of these model particles in colloid science are given. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the free-volume theory (FVT) of Lekkerkerker et al. [Europhys. Lett. 20 (1992) 559] for the phase behavior of colloids in the presence of non-adsorbing polymer and we extend this theory in several aspects: (i) We take the solvent into account as a separate component and show that the natural thermodynamic parameter for the polymer properties is the insertion work Pi(v), where Pi is the osmotic pressure of the (external) polymer solution and v the volume of a colloid particle. (ii) Curvature effects are included along the lines of Aarts et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matt. 14 (2002) 7551] but we find accurate simple power laws which simplify the mathematical procedure considerably. (iii) We find analytical forms for the first, second, and third derivatives of the grand potential, needed for the calculation of the colloid chemical potential, the pressure, gas-liquid critical points and the critical endpoint (cep), where the (stable) critical line ends and then coincides with the triple point. This cep determines the boundary condition for a stable liquid. We first apply these modifications to the so-called colloid limit, where the size ratio q(R)=R/a between the radius of gyration R of the polymer and the particle radius a is small. In this limit the binodal polymer concentrations are below overlap: the depletion thickness delta is nearly equal to R, and Pi can be approximated by the ideal (van't Hoff) law Pi=Pi(0)=phi/N, where phi is the polymer volume fraction and N the number of segments per chain. The results are close to those of the original Lekkerkerker theory. However, our analysis enables very simple analytical expressions for the polymer and colloid concentrations in the critical and triple points and along the binodals as a function of q(R). Also the position of the cep is found analytically. In order to make the model applicable to higher size ratio's q(R) (including the so-called protein limit where q(R)>1) further extensions are needed. We introduce the size ratio q=delta/a, where the depletion thickness delta is no longer of order R. In the protein limit the binodal concentrations are above overlap. In such semidilute solutions delta approximately xi, where the De Gennes blob size (correlation length) xi scales as xi approximately phi(-gamma), with gamma=0.77 for good solvents and gamma=1 for a theta solvent. In this limit Pi=Pi(sd) approximately phi(3gamma). We now apply the following additional modifications: With these latter two modifications we obtain again a fully analytical model with simple equations for critical and triple points as a function of q(R). In the protein limit the binodal polymer concentrations scale as q(R)(1/gamma), and phase diagrams phiq(R)(-1/gamma) versus the colloid concentration eta become universal (i.e., independent of the size ratio q(R)). The predictions of this generalized free-volume theory (GFVT) are in excellent agreement with experiment and with computer simulations, not only for the colloid limit but also for the protein limit (and the crossover between these limits). The q(R)(1/gamma) scaling is accurately reproduced by both simulations and other theoretical models. The liquid window is the region between phi(c) (critical point) and phi(t) (triple point). In terms of the ratio phi(t)/phi(c) the liquid window extends from 1 in the cep (here phi(t)-phi(c)=0) to 2.2 in the protein limit. Hence, the liquid window is narrow: it covers at most a factor 2.2 in (external) polymer concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {The addition of non-adsorbing polymer to a colloidal suspension induces an interparticle 'depletion' attraction whose range and depth can be 'tuned' independently by altering the polymer's molecular weight and concentration respectively. Over the past decade, one particularly simple experimental realization of such a mixture has been studied in considerable detail: nearly-hard-sphere particles of poly(methyl methacrylate) and random-coil polystyrene dispersed in simple hydrocarbon solvents (mainly cis-decalin). The simplicity of the system has enabled rather detailed comparison of experimental findings with theory and simulation. Here I review the current understanding of the equilibrium phase behaviour, structure, phase transition kinetics, and metastability of this Model colloid-polymer mixture. These findings form a useful reference point for understanding more complex mixtures. Moreover, in some cases, insights gained from studying this model system have relevance beyond soft-condensed-matter physics, e.g. in understanding the liquid state, in controlling protein crystallization, and in elucidating the nature of glasses.},

  Abstract                 = {Hard-sphere colloids are popular as models for testing fundamental theories in condensed matter and statistical physics, from crystal nucleation to the glass transition. A single parameter, the volume fraction (phi), characterizes an ideal, monodisperse hard-sphere suspension. In comparing experiments with theories and simulation, researchers to date have paid little attention to likely uncertainties in experimentally-quoted phi values. We critically review the experimental measurement of phi in hard-sphere colloids, and show that while statistical uncertainties in comparing relative values of phi can be as low as 0.0001, systematic errors of 3-6\% are probably unavoidable. The consequences of this are illustrated by way of a case study comparing literature data sets on hard-sphere viscosity and diffusion.},

  Abstract                 = {We use confocal laser scanning microscopy to measure interactions in colloidal suspensions. By inverting the radial distribution function, determined by tracking the particle coordinates, we obtain the effective interaction between the colloidal particles. Although this method can be applied to arbitrary colloidal interactions, here we demonstrate its efficacy with two well-known systems for which accurate theories are available: a colloid-polymer mixture and binary hard spheres. The high sensitivity of this method allows for the precise determination of complex interactions, as exemplified, for example, by the accurate resolution of the oscillatory effective potential of the binary hard sphere system. We argue that the method is particularly well suited for the determination of attractive forces.},
